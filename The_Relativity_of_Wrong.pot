"In the early days of civilization, the general feeling was that the earth "

"Another way of looking at it is to ask what is the \"curvature\" of the "

"There were reasons, to be sure, to find the flat-earth theory unsatisfactory "

"About a century after Aristotle, the Greek philosopher Eratosthenes noted "

"Isaac Newton, toward the end of the seventeenth century, showed that a "
